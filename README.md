I could not fork the project normally, I do not know for what reason (but I guess), although in general I do not give a fuck

It's a Custom version of Combat Stance Standalone (https://github.com/space-commits/SPT-Combat-Stances)

Changes:
1) Added a check on Scav so that tactical sprinting and alternate pistol positions do not apply to them, only PMCs

2) Removed unnecessary stances (for me):
- Short-Stock - totally pointless stance, because gun collision already works in the game
- High Ready - was cut by 99%, in fact, only tactical sprinting was left of it
- Cycle Stance - the stances are now full adaptive, then keybind is not needed
  
3) Significantly reduced number of parameters in the BepInEx menu

4) Some changes in code (mostly cleaning)
